# Question 3.2: Flatten Function #
##################################

# Instructions: Write a recursive algorithm that outputs a list of integers which are extracted from a nested set 
# of iterable lists. Your function should flatten a nested structure of integers contained in various lists into a 
# simple list of integers. For example if the input is [1,2,[3,4],[[5],6,7]] then return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Please be 
# sure to use recursion for this exercise. 

# Complete the function below and test your function against the provided test cases.
# Do not use any external libraries, please use only base python functions and data types.

# Input: A nested structure built as a list of lists and/or integers
# Output: A list of all integers contained in the nested iterable list structure

# Example 1: If input_list = [1,2,[3,4],[[5],6,7]] then the return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
# Example 2: If input_list = [[1,2],[[3]],5,6] then return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

# Question 4.1: Caesar Cipher #
###############################

# Instructions: Complete the class declaration in below to create a custom, user-defined data structure that can save 
# a cipherkey, an alphabet, and also perform encryption and decryption of a message using a Caesar Cipher. A Caesar Cipher 
# is a simple encryption method that shifts all letters by a fixed offset specified by the cipherkey's location in the 
# alphabet. E.g. if our alphabet is the standard lower-case English letters abc...xyz and our message is "x" and our 
# cipherkey is "b" then the resulting ciphertext would be "y" since the cipherkey "b" corresponds to the index 1 letter 
# of the alphabet so we offset the plaintext message "x" by +1 letter to get "y". If our cipherkey was "d", we would 
# offset by 3 since "d" is at index 3 in the alphabet (indexing from 0) which would result in our message being encrypted 
# to "a". We wrap around to the start of the alphabet if our offset exceeds the last letter. Likewise, for decryption, 
# instead of offsetting forward, we offset backwards to decrypt a ciphertext into plaintext. See the diagram in the pdf
# instructions guide for a visual. Note, an alphabet is any list of string characters provided to the class, it need not
# be restricted to the default abc...xyz, your code should be robust to operate on any arbitrary alphabet provided.

# Do not change the names of the methods or class. Do not use external libraries of data structures. 

# Your code should include the following methods:

# __init__: Write a constructor method that takes 2 input arguments specifying the alphabet to use and a cipherkey.
# Both should be stored as attributes. The default alphabet if none is provided should be the 26 lower-case letters
# of the English alphabet i.e. abc...xyz and None as a default for the cipherkey.

# encrypt: Write a method that takes in a plaintext string to be encrypted and a string that designates the key
# from the alphabet to use as the cipherkey. If the cipherkey is not an element of the alphabet, raise an AttributeError.
# If no key provided, default to the key stored from the initialization. If an input character of the plaintext is not 
# in the alphabet, do not alter it, return it as is. 
# Input: plaintext string and cipherkey string. Output: ciphertext string

# decrypt: Write a method that takes in a ciphertext string to be decrypted and a string that designates the key
# from the alphabet to use as the cipherkey. If the cipherkey is not an element of the alphabet, raise an AttributeError. 
# If no key provided, default to the key stored from the initialization. If an input character of the ciphertext is not 
# in the alphabet, do not alter it, return it as is. 
# Input: ciphertext string. Output: plaintext string


###############################################
# Question 4.2: Caesar Cipher Auto-Decryption #
###############################################

# Instructions: Add to the CaesarCipher class a new method called auto_decrypt() that will automatically try to guess the 
# correct cipherkey of the message by trying each character in the saved alphabet and computing the % of words recognized in 
# the English language contained in the resulting plaintext. Return a tuple containing the decrypted plaintext and  
# auto-detected cipherkey. You may add early stopping and stop if you find a cipherkey that produces a plaintext output with  
# at least 85% words recognized in the English word dictionary. If no key produces at least 85% recognizable words, then return 
# the key with the highest % of recognized words. The english_word_list has been read in for you, pass in this object by 
# reference into your method call. Add an optional argument called verbose with a default of False that will print out the 
# % of words recognized as English words for each character tried as cipherkey to track the progress of auto-detection.

# Note, all words in the  english_word_list are in lower case, you should make comparisons in lower case for each word. 
# Input: ciphertext string. Output: tuple containing the plaintext string and the detected cipherkey

### Bonus Problem: Can you think of a faster way to auto-decrypt a secret message (in English) that was encrypted using a Caesar 
# cipher? Briefly describe your approach and add an additional method to CaesarCipher below called auto_decrypt_bonus() if you're 
# up for the challenge. The top 5 fastest submissions by average runtime on a set of hidden test cases that return the correct 
# output for all test cases will earn extra credit on this assignment. The class object is instantiated once at the start and all 
# test cases are run on it. Assume the alphabet used for this question is the list of standard English lower case letters i.e. abc...xyz. 
# This implies also that all input letters of the ciphertext will be lower case English letters. Do not use any external libraries, 
# please use only base python functions and objects.

# Hint: A table containing the average frequency of use for each letter in the alphabet in written English text has also been 
# provided that you can utilize in your approach. 

# Input: ciphertext string. Output: tuple containing the plaintext string and the detected cipherkey (same as Part 2a)

# Question 4.3: VigenÃ¨re Cipher #
#################################

# Instructions: Implement a class-based VigenÃ¨re Cipher by completing the starter code for VigenereCipher below. Your data 
# structure should have a method for encryption and decryption. A VigenÃ¨re cipher can be thought of as a generalization of 
# a Caesar cipher. VigenÃ¨re ciphers convert plaintext to ciphertext using a cipherkey that may be of length 1 or greater 
# where each subsequent character in the cipherkey specifies the alphabetical offset for each subsequent plaintext letter 
# being encrypted. The cipherkey is resued from start to end as many times as needed to encrypt or decrypt the entire message. 
# A Caesar cipher is a special case of a VigenÃ¨re cipher where the cipherkey is of length 1. 

# Note, an alphabet is any list of string characters provided to the class, it need not be restricted to the default abc...xyz,
#  your code should be robust to operate on any arbitrary alphabet provided. Do not use any external libraries. 

# Your code should include the following methods:

# __init__: Write a constructor method that takes 2 input arguments specifying the alphabet to use and a cipherkey.
# Both should be stored as attributes. The default alphabet if none is provided should be the 26 lower-case letters
# of the English alphabet i.e. abc...xyz and None as a default for the cipherkey.

# encrypt: Write a method that takes in a plaintext string to be encrypted and a string that designates the cipherkey
# containing characters from the saved alphabet. If a character in the cipherkey is not an element of the alphabet, raise 
# an AttributeError. If no key provided, default to the key stored from the initialization. If an input character of the 
# plaintext is not in the saved alphabet, do not alter it, return it as is. 
# Input: plaintext string and cipherkey string. Output: ciphertext string

# decrypt: Write a method that takes in a ciphertext string to be decrypted and a string that designates the cipherkey
# containing characters from the saved alphabet. If a character in the cipherkey is not an element of the alphabet, raise 
# an AttributeError. If no key provided, default to the key stored from the initialization. If an input character of the 
# ciphertext is not in the saved alphabet, do not alter it, return it as is. 
# Input: ciphertext string and cipherkey string. Output: plaintext string

# Hint: Consider using a Python generator to iteratively cycle through the letters of the cipherkey on loop.
